# Hockey Game mechanics

This is a Unity project that was created to research main gameplay mechanics for a hockey game.
I was inspired by the N64s Wayne Gretzky's 3D hockey 98: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky%27s_3D_Hockey_%2798

It is a work in progress, but feel free to download and use for your own project.

Features: 
User can play with Xbox Controller and shoot with the A button
User can alternatively use the keyboard arrows and shoot with the space bar

You can run and test the game here:
